# mtlMicro
Presentations, code sharing for the mtlMICRO group.
# About
The MtlMICRO group is a monthly discussion group on microbial ecology and evolution. Currently, five labs from four Montreal universities are participating in this group.
# What this repo is for
For posting presentations or workshop slides as we go along. Since many of us are working with genomic data, this can be a place to share code as well.
