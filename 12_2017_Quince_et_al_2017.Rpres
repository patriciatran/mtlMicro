WELCOME!
========================================================
Welcome to the First MtlMicro Meeting!
Thank you all for attending and for the paper suggestions.

This paper was suggested by Nicolas Tromas from the Shapiro Lab. 

ABSTRACT
========================================================

Problem:
Large multi-sample metagenomes are generated, but strain variation results in fragmentary co-assemblies
Therefore, the bins (MAGs) are can be an aggregate of closely related strains.

What DESMAN is:
a tools that identifies varients in core genes and uses co-occurence accross samples to link these variants into haplotypes and abundance profiles

How this was tested:
- in silico
- A complex 50-species 210-genome 96-samples synthetic mock data set and applied to the Tara Oceans Microbiome

The basics...What's a metagenome?
========================================================
A metagenome is a genome reconstructed (metagenome-assembled-genomes, or MAGs, or bin) from all the DNA extracted from an environmental sample.

Overview of the DESMAN pipeline

Some key terms
====================================
>"We developped a full **Bayesian Model**, fitted by a **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** **Gibbs sampler**, to learn the strain frequencies, their **haplotypes** and allso sequencing error rates. To improve **convergence**, we initialize the Gibbs sampler using a **non-negative matrix factorisation** (NMF), or more properly **non-negative tensor factorisation (NTF)**, a method from machine learning that is equivalent to the **maximum likelihood solution**" 

(Second page of PDF, Quince et al. 2017)

Definitions
====================================
Bayesian Model:

**MCMC**: A method to sample from and to computing expectations with high-dimensional probability distributions. Check out this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY> for an intro to it.

Gibbs Sampler: One type of MCMC. 

Convergence:

Non-negative matrix factorisation:

Non-negative tensor factorisation:

Maximum-likelihood:

E.coli O104:H4 outbreak
====================================
Applied the algorithm to 53 human feacal samples from the 2011 STEC O104:H4 outbreak

Starting point: 
- unknown number of exact strains present in the population nor their proportions
- We know one of these strains, from cultured isolate that was sequenced.
- Can we use DESMAN to find/predict that particular strain?

A few points:
20 samples were used because they had mean coverage of SCSG (Single core genes) greater than 5. Smaller than that is hard to deconvolute.

Validation of reconstructed strains

TARA Oceans plankton microbiome survey
====================================
7.2 TB of metagenomic data, 243 samples accross 68 locations from epipelagic and mesopelagic waters globally

- No attemps to bin into MAGs in the original study
- Delmont et al., 2011 : Extracted 957 MAGs from 93 of these samples (Using CONCOCT and ANVI'O)
    + 32 of the most abundant MAGS with 75% of SCG %>% DESMAN
    + 4 Actinobacteria, 6 Bacteroidetes, 1 *Candidatus Marinimicrobia*, 1 Chloroflexi, 3 Euryarchaeota and 17 Proteobacteria

Open-ended discussion
====================================
Example questions to discuss:

- In which scenarios would deconvoluting MAGs be useful? For what kind of questions?
- Would this method can useful in your research?
- What binning algorithm do you use for your research? What are the pros and cons you have encountered?
